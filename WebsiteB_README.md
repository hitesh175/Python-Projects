# Python-Project

This is a website blocker that allows users to specify certain hours during which specified websites will be blocked on their computer. The script edits the system's hosts file to redirect blocked websites to the loopback IP address, effectively preventing access to these websites during the specified hours.

Features:

~ Blocks websites during a specified time range.
~ Cross-platform support for both Linux and Windows operating systems.
~ Easy configuration of websites to block.
~ Gracefully handles permission errors when editing the hosts file.
